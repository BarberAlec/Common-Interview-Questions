Virtu:
1.) Given an integer X, find the minimum distance to the closest fib number. Example: X=6, solution is 1 as 6 is one away from 5. Example: X=-2, solution is 2 as is 2 away from 0

2.) Given a list A, the first value is the weight of a box before any apples are added. The [1:] indexes are the weights of apples. Given that the box cannot be more than 5000 in weight,
what is the maximum number of apples that can fit inside the box.

3.) HexSpeak - convert a decimal number in string format to hex, then convert that HEX to hexspeak.       
  lut={10:'A',11:'B',12:'C',13:'D',14:'E',15:'F',0:'O',1:'I'}

4.) Given a String S, what are the maximum number of unique substrings you can make like the following. S=“zzzyz”, ans is 9. 4 ‘z’, 2 ‘zz’, 1 ‘zzz’,1 ‘zzzz’, 1 ‘y’ (thought the ans was 8, but now less sure….)
